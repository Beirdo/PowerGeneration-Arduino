# PowerGeneration-Arduino
I am in the process of creating some boards to allow me to be a bit more off-grid-ish while camping or otherwise outdoors.  This repository contains the Arduino code required to run the various boards.  It is intended to be checked out at a top-level Arduino workspace.

# Repository layout

* **/docs** - Documentation
* **/libraries** - Arduino libraries used by the various sketches (mostly git submodules)
* **/firmware** - Arduino sketches for the boards
